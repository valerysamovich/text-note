=========

AngularJS Note is a Single Page Application (SPA).

Application Sceleton
--------------------

 - The "html" element is the "container" for the AngularJS application (**ng-app=**).
 - A "div" elements defines the scope of an AngualrJS controller (**ng-controller=**).
 - An aaplication file(**my...App.js**) defines the application module code.
 - A controller file(s) (**my...Ctrl.js**) defines the controller code.

How Does it Work
----------------

 - The recommended placement for AngularJS script tags is at taahe bottom of thr "body" element.
 - Application code (module and controllers) must be loaded after the library.
 - The ng-app directive should be placed at the root element application
 - On or more ng-controllers directives define the application controllers. Each controller has its own scope: the HTML element where they were defined.
